Borrow a bear; lend a llama. A pet sharing app for mobile devices.
 <br>
 <br>
Our app is aimed at a wide demographic and offers a solution to 
people who don't want or are unable to commit to full time pet 
ownership. Pet companionship and time spent with pets can be a 
great boost to mental health and this app aims to make pets more 
accessible to everyone.
You can search for pets using various queries and then organise 
your pet shares using our real-time messaging feature. You can 
leave reviews on other users‚Äô profiles and add, edit and delete pets 
on your own.
